# Shifter

The Shifter is an external tool for creating Socially Distant user interface skins and publishing them to the Steam Workshop.

Along with the ability to create new skins for the game, the Shifter allows one to import skin files from ShiftOS. These skins will be converted to the Socially Distant format and can then be further edited.

Note: This is a work-in-progress.
